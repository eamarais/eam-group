# My current questions or skills to learn

1> how to code in main top level scripting
2> how to use parallel processing to speed up any processing step? like reading multiple netcdf files using NetCDF or xarray?
3> use dask to handle large data frames?
4> learn seaborn, plotly, bokeh for data visualisation
5> learn pakcages for statistical analysis
6> test airbase package (https://pypi.org/project/airbase/) again, if it works well, share it with the group
